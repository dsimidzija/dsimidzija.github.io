The problem is that the information is scattered all over the internet: on Github, official SCS forums, a few unofficial and obscure ones, several subreddits, etc. This is my attempt at documenting the ridiculous hacks totally legit steps I did, in case someone else fi... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Introducing Althaia: a speedy Marshmallow fork</title><link href="/posts/introducing-althaia-speedy-marshmallow-fork/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing Althaia: a speedy Marshmallow fork" /><published>2021-12-30T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2021-12-30T00:00:00+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/introducing-althaia-speedy-marshmallow-fork/</id> <content src="/posts/introducing-althaia-speedy-marshmallow-fork/" /> <author> <name>Dusko Simidzija</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> Althaia is a drop-in replacement for the #1 Python serialization library - marshmallow. It is also a shallow fork of marshmallow, basically using the entire marshmallow source with a few patches to speed up the dump operations. TL;DR $ pip install althaia # patch python's sys.meta_path to allow althaia to handle all marshmallow imports import althaia althaia.patch() # use marshmallow... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Speeding up pytest + sqlalchemy</title><link href="/posts/speeding-up-pytest-sqlalchemy/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Speeding up pytest + sqlalchemy" /><published>2020-03-22T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2021-12-30T18:19:45+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/speeding-up-pytest-sqlalchemy/</id> <content src="/posts/speeding-up-pytest-sqlalchemy/" /> <author> <name>Dusko Simidzija</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> A large chunk of python projects use SQLAlchemy as ORM, and in doing so may actually be doubling their test runs. One of the more interesting things I discovered while running tests with profiling on is the fact that the most expensive operations were actually involving database fixtures and user auth. This didn’t make any sense at first, because it was supposed to be a very cheap set of ope... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>How not to do database migrations</title><link href="/posts/how-not-to-do-database-migrations/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How not to do database migrations" /><published>2015-07-08T00:00:00+00:00</published> <updated>2021-12-30T18:19:45+00:00</updated> <id>/posts/how-not-to-do-database-migrations/</id> <content src="/posts/how-not-to-do-database-migrations/" /> <author> <name>Dusko Simidzija</name> </author> <category term="Programming" /> <summary> This is a short story of how I lost all my SMS messages on my Android phone, then got (most of) them back, and in the process learned how horrible Android TelephonyProvider is.
