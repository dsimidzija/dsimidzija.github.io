My name is [Duško](https://forvo.com/word/du%C5%A1ko/#hr) Simidžija and I am a software engineer from [Croatia][hr].

My passion is writing simple and functional applications, with readable and
maintainable code.

My engineering career officially started in 2005, but I've been programming ever since I got my hands on my first PC.
Although I have an engineering degree, I consider myself mostly self taught, always through practical experience and
experimentation. I have worked with a wide range of technologies and frameworks, both web and desktop related.
I would tell you which ones if it mattered, but I consider my experience and knowledge to be language-agnostic.
I've worked both on solo and team projects, designed and created services, refactored and refurbished old ones,
and I've also done long-term maintenance work including direct contact with clients.

I always insist on using engineering best practices and principles. When this is not possible due to deadline
pressures, I will argue that you need to reduce the scope instead of sacrificing the quality of your code/application.
I will also be very mad at the management for a while, and may incite a 1789. or 1917. styled theme party.

One of my core strengths are software architecture and design patterns, which I enjoy doing, and consider them one of
the more important aspects a serious software engineer should know and practice. It is a toolkit by which one can write
not only correct, but also stable and maintainable solutions.

My main weakness is my thoroughness and occasional perfectionism, which can be perceived as general slowness or
intentional slacking. Second main weakness is the fact that I will do anything to avoid travelling, due to
pretty persistant and extreme motion sickness.

I am also a long term Linux user and open-source supporter. Over the years, I've contributed to several open-source
projects under various aliases.

My other interests are too numerous to list, but they at least include playing chess and [WeiQi][], [(board)gaming][bgg],
learning how to play the drums, leaning Mandarin Chinese, discussing controversial topics of all kinds,
and reading a lot of articles and books.

There's also a bit about me on my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]
