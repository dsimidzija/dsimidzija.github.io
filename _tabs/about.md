My name is Duško Simidžija and I am a software engineer from [Croatia][hr].

My passion is writing simple and functional applications, with readable and
maintainable code.

During my career - which officially started in 2005 - I've worked quite a long
time with C#/.NET, (Cake)PHP (and naturally, with SQL Server and MySQL). I have
since fallen in love with Python and PostgreSQL. Although these are and were my
primary tools at work, I always strive to learn and use new languages,
frameworks and tools. This includes both web-related things as well as desktop.
I would tell you which ones if it mattered, but I consider my experience and
knowledge to be language-agnostic. I've worked both on solo and team projects,
and I've also done maintenance work including direct contact with clients.

I "insist" on engineering best practices such as proper version control usage
(preferably [Git][]), [DRY][], [KISS][] and various other software engineering
principles. When this is not possible due to deadline pressures, I will argue
that you need to reduce the scope instead of sacrificing the quality of your
code/application. I will also be very mad at the management for a while. My
strengths are being good at architecture design and being thorough, but my main
weakness is that same thoroughness (which can be perceived as slowness or
slacking) and the fact that I will do anything to avoid travelling...due to
motion sickness.

I am also a Linux user and open-source supporter. Over time, I've contributed
to several open-source projects under various aliases.

My other interests are too numerous to list, but they at least include playing
chess and [weiqi][], (board)gaming, learning how to play the drums, how to
speak Mandarin Chinese, and reading a lot of books.

There's also a bit about me on my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]
