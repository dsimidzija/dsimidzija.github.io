My name is Du&scaron;ko Simid&zcaron;ija and I am a software engineer from [Croatia][hr].

My passion is writing simple and functional applications, with readable and maintainable code.

During my career - which officially started in 2005 - I've worked mostly with C#/.NET, (Cake)PHP (and naturally, with SQL Server and MySQL). Although these are were my primary tools at work, I always strive to learn and use new languages, frameworks and tools. This includes various web-related things as well as desktop (Windows). I would tell you which ones if it mattered, but I consider my experience and knowledge to be language-agnostic. I've worked both on solo and in team projects and I've also done maintenance work including direct contact with clients.

I "insist" on engineering best practices such as proper version control usage (preferably [Git][]), [DRY][], [KISS][] and various other software engineering principles. When this is not possible due to deadline pressures, I will argue that you need to reduce the scope instead of sacrificing the quality of code/application. I will also be very mad at the management for a while. My strengths are being good at architecture design and being thorough, but my main weakness is that same thoroughness (which can be perceived as slowness or slacking) and the fact that I will do anything to avoid travelling...due to motion sickness.

I am also a Linux user and open-source supporter. Over time, I've contributed to several open-source projects under various aliases.

My other interests are too numerous to list, but they at least include playing chess and [weiqi][], learning how to play the piano, how to speak Mandarin Chinese and reading a lot of books.

There's also a bit about me in my [LinkedIn profile][linkedin]
